### History

### Important notes

This template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX.
The main document font is called Fontin and can be downloaded for 
free from here: http://www.exljbris.com/fontin.html.

To intall the fonts on Mac OS X open the `Font Book` and drag 
the folder `Fontin` to it.

Appears to be a problem with the *default* output driver `xdvipdfmx` 
and the Fontin fonts. So to compile the `.tex` use istead `xdv2pdf`:

    xelatex -output-driver=xdv2pdf file.tex
